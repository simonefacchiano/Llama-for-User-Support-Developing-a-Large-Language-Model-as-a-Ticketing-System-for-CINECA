quantized|In LEONARDO, how many cores is one GPU treated as, in accounting terms?|In LEONARDO, how many cores is one GPU treated as, in accounting terms? In LEONARDO, one GPU is treated as 1 core in accounting terms. This means that the GPU is considered a single processing unit, and its resources are allocated accordingly. However, in reality, a GPU can have multiple processing units, known as CUDA cores (for NVIDIA GPUs) or stream processors (for AMD GPUs), which can perform multiple tasks concurrently. This is known as parallel processing, and it allows GPUs to perform complex tasks much faster than CPUs. So, while a GPU is treated as 1 core in LEONARDO, it can actually perform many more tasks than a single CPU core. This is why GPUs are often used for tasks that require a lot of parallel processing, such as graphics rendering, machine|2.814401149749756|147|18.452950477600098

Yes, it is mandatory to use 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) to access CINECA’s HPC systems. The use of 2FA is required by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR) to ensure the security of the HPC systems. This is a policy decision that applies to all users of the HPC systems, and it is enforced by the system administrators. The 2FA access is a way to add an extra layer of security to the login process, by requiring the user to provide a second factor, in addition to the password. This second factor can be a code sent by SMS, a code generated by an authenticator app, or a fingerprint. The use of 2FA is a best practice for security, and it is widely adopted by many organizations and institutions. The use of 2FA|2.559478282928467|173|21.4939968585968

In the corporate billing system on CINECA's HPC, the cost of a batch job is calculated based on the following factors: 1. Resource usage: The cost is calculated based on the resources consumed by the job, such as CPU time, memory, and storage. The system uses a pricing model based on the total amount of resources consumed during the job execution. 2. Job duration: The longer the job runs, the more resources it consumes, and therefore the higher the cost. 3. Priority: The system also takes into account the priority assigned to the job by the user. Higher-priority jobs are charged at a higher rate than lower-priority jobs. 4. User: The cost is also influenced by the user who submitted the job.

quantized|What does the 'PD' status in the job queue mean on CINECA’s HPC?|"What does the 'PD' status in the job queue mean on CINECA’s HPC? CINECA is a supercomputing center in Italy, and on their cluster, you can find the 'PD' status in the job queue. The 'PD' status stands for ""Pending Disk I/O"". It means that the job is waiting for the disk I/O operations to complete. This can happen when a job is requesting data from the filesystem or when it is writing data to the filesystem, but the filesystem is busy or has some issues. In this case, the job is waiting for the filesystem to finish its tasks before it can proceed. You can try to cancel the job or restart it once the filesystem is free. The 'PD' status is a common issue on clusters with high disk I/O demand, so it is essential to monitor the filesystem and adjust the job submission accordingly.
