In this section we will describe how this cost is calculated and what are the factors that affect it.

Actually, a ton is a unit of mass, not a unit of volume. So, we need to define what we mean by a ""ton of feathers"" and a ""ton of bricks"". We can define a ton as 2,000 pounds, or 1,000 kilograms. So, a ""ton of feathers"" would be 2,000 pounds of feathers, and a ""ton of bricks"" would be 2,000 pounds of bricks. Now, the question is, how much do these two things exist? Actually, a ton of feathers would be a lot of individual feathers, whereas a ton of bricks would be a small number of individual bricks. So, the question is, how many individual feathers would there be in a ton of feathers, and how many individual bricks would there be in a ton of bricks?

Therefore, you need to take out 20 socks. Then you will have 20 - 10 = 10 matches. So the minimum number of socks you need to take out is 20. I hope it is correct. Am I right?
