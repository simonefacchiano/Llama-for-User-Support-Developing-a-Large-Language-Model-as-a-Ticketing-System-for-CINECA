In Leonardo, how many cores is a GPU treated as in terms of accounting?|8|A single GPU is treated as 8 cores for the purpose of accounting. This is because the GPU is allocated 8 virtual CPU (vCPU) in the system. So, if you request 4 GPUs, this will be accounted as 8*4=32 cores in total. Therefore, in terms of accounting, a single GPU is treated as if it were 8 full cores. This is because 8 virtual CPU (vCPU) are allocated to the GPU in the system. In case you need to know more about the usage of the GPU or cores, you can consult the following link: https://wiki.u-gov.it/confluence/display/SCAIUS/How+the+GPUs+are+accounted+in+the+system In case you require additional support, please don't hesitate to contact us.

How are HPC resources allocated on CINECA's HPC systems?|Through ISCRA projects, EuroHPC projects, agreements with Italian research institutions, or general applications from users or industries|At CINECA, the allocation of the HPC resources is usually performed on a project basis. In fact, users can submit their jobs to the cluster, specifying their project name and the corresponding resources required. The scheduling system is responsible for allocating the resources to the jobs, on the basis of their priority and the availability of the requested resources.  On the Leonardo cluster, which is one of the most important and powerful at CINECA, there is a policy to allocate the resources to the users in the form of nodes and hours. Users can request a number of nodes and hours of CPU time to be allocated to their jobs. The number of hours is usually requested by the users for each job and the number of nodes depends on the type of job and the resources required by the job. Once the job is submitted by the user, it will run until the number of hours requested is exhausted. After that, the job will terminate. Therefore, users should submit their jobs in advance to ensure that the

How is the cost of a batch job calculated in the corporate billing system on CINECA's HPC?|Based on the elapsed time and the number of reserved cores|The cost of a batch job in CINECA's HPC (on Leonardo) is based on the job runtime, the number of nodes used, and the job's priority. There are two types of costs: CPU time and storage. The total cost of a batch job is calculated as follows: 1. CPU time: It is associated with the wall clock time of the job. The cost is calculated as the number of seconds multiplied by the corresponding unit price. Please refer to the following CINECA's HPC Policy: https://www.hpc.cineca.it/center/policies/billing-system. 2. Storage: It is associated with the job's storage usage. CINECA uses the concept of 'budget' to manage the storage budget for all HPC users.

The Norwegian artist Edvard Munch is famous for painting which iconic piece?|The Scream|You can start to profile your program by adding the option -pg at the gfortran compile time, then run your program and collect the profiling data by running the gprof command. The gprof command is used to create the output file which is named with the same name as your executable but with.gmon extension. For example, for a program named myexec, the profiling data will be stored in a file named myexec.gmon. You can run gprof with the -annotated-source option to get the profiling data for each line of your program. If you have an MPI program, you can profile each process separately by adding the variable GMON_OUT_PREFIX to your environment before running the program. For the NVIDIA nvhpc (ex PORTLAND PGI + NVIDIA CUDA), you can use the profiler available in the module nvhpc to profile your MPI programs. For your scripts you can use modules to manage the installation of software on your user profile. For the NVIDIA, you
